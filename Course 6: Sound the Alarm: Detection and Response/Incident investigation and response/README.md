# Incident investigation and response
> You will learn about the various processes and procedures in the stages of incident detection, investigation, analysis, and response. Then, you'll analyze the details of suspicious file hashes. You'll learn about the importance of documentation and evidence collection during the detection and response stages. Finally, you'll approximate an incident’s chronology by mapping artifacts to reconstruct an incident’s timeline.
# Learning Objectives
- Perform artifact investigations to analyze and verify security incidents.
- Illustrate documentation best practices during the incident response lifecycle.
- Assess alerts using evidence and determine the appropriate triaging steps.
- Identify the steps to contain, eradicate, and recover from an incident.
- Describe the processes and procedures involved in the post-incident phase.
