So far, you've focused on learning about cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. Although security controls can be used to protect people and assets, it's not possible to completely eliminate the risk of a cybersecurity incident. It's important that you equip yourself with the knowledge and tools to effectively respond to potential security incidents in the future.

For this discussion, consider the following questions:

- What aspects of incident detection and response are you most excited to learn about?
- Which skills do you think are most important for a cybersecurity professional working in incident detection and response?
- Think about a cybersecurity incident you may be familiar with. What are some examples of the response actions?

Please write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing your thoughts about cybersecurity incidents.
