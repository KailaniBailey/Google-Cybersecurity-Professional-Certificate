# Network monitoring and analysis
> You will explore network analysis tools, commonly referred to as packet sniffers. In particular, you'll sniff the network and analyze packets for malicious threats. You'll also craft filtering commands to analyze the contents of captured packets.
# Learning Objectives
- Describe how network traffic analysis can help to detect, prevent, and respond to security incidents.
- Use packet sniffing tools to capture and view network communications.
- Analyze packets to interpret network communications.
