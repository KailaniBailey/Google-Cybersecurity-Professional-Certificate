# Work with strings and lists
> You will learn more options for working with strings and lists in Python, and discover methods that can be applied to these data types. You'll apply this knowledge to write a short algorithm. Finally, you'll use regular expressions to search for patterns in strings.
# Learning Objectives
- Use Python to work with strings and lists.
- Write a simple algorithm.
- Use regular expressions to extract information from text.
