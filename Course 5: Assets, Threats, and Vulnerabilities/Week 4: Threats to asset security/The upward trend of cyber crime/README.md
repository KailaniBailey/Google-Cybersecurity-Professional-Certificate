# The upward trend of cyber crime
Cyber crime is a costly risk to businesses and private individuals alike. The economic cost of cyber crime is expected to continue growing in the years ahead as attackers find new ways to exploit existing systems and new technologies emergeâ€”like artificial intelligence.

Take a moment to consider the upward trend of cyber crime:

- How might emerging technologies present new challenges?
- Between social engineering, malware, web-based exploits, or other threats, which do you expect to pose the greatest risk to cybersecurity in the future? Why?
- How might the skills that you've learned in the program help slow the rise of cyber crime?

Write 1-2 paragraphs (100-200 words) sharing your outlook on the upward trend of cyber crime.
