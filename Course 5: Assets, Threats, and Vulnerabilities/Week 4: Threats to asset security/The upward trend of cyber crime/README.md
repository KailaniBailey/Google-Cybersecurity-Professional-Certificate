# The upward trend of cyber crime
Cyber crime is a costly risk to businesses and private individuals alike. The economic cost of cyber crime is expected to continue growing in the years ahead as attackers find new ways to exploit existing systems and new technologies emergeâ€”like artificial intelligence.

Take a moment to consider the upward trend of cyber crime:

- How might emerging technologies present new challenges?
- Between social engineering, malware, web-based exploits, or other threats, which do you expect to pose the greatest risk to cybersecurity in the future? Why?
- How might the skills that you've learned in the program help slow the rise of cyber crime?

Write 1-2 paragraphs (100-200 words) sharing your outlook on the upward trend of cyber crime.

## My Response
> Emerging technologies might present new challenges by introducing new problems that have yet to be considered or tested, leading to potential leaks, hacks, even privacy invasions. In terms of future threats to cybersecurity, I believe that social engineering and web-based exploits pose the greatest risks due to the increased need and/or desire for websites for personal use as well as professional business branding for expansion and reach to potential clients. The skills I've learned about so far in these program, however, will help to slow the rise of cyber crime by contributing to the defense techniques that can be created and implemented when working on a security team in the future.
