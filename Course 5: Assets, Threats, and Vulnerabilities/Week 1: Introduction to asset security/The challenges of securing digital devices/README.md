# The challenges of securing digital devices
Data owners and data custodians are both equally responsible for securing information. For example, as a data owner you might protect a social media account by setting a strong password. However, your information can still be compromised if data custodians, such as the employees of the social media company, use weak passwords to secure their accounts.

The devices you use in your daily life handle many types of information. Consider how you handle data based on your relationship to it.

- As a data owner, how do you approach securing different types of information?
- As a data custodian, how might it be challenging to protect the privacy of other people's information?
- How do existing and emerging technologies factor into the challenges of safe data handling?
