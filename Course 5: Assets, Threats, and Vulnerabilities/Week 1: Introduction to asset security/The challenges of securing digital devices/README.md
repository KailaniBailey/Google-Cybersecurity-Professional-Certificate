# The challenges of securing digital devices
Data owners and data custodians are both equally responsible for securing information. For example, as a data owner you might protect a social media account by setting a strong password. However, your information can still be compromised if data custodians, such as the employees of the social media company, use weak passwords to secure their accounts.

The devices you use in your daily life handle many types of information. Consider how you handle data based on your relationship to it.

- As a data owner, how do you approach securing different types of information?
- As a data custodian, how might it be challenging to protect the privacy of other people's information?
- How do existing and emerging technologies factor into the challenges of safe data handling?

## My Response
> I approach securing different types of information according to how sensitive the information is. Physical assets, I will keep in specific places and won't always make it known where I keep these items. Digital assets or any other sensitive data, I will typically put on a tier and handle them accordingly.

> On the other hand, it might be challenging protecting the privacy of other people's information in terms of the kind of passwords I choose and making sure that those passwords are strong enough to keep confidential or restricted information secured as needed.

> Existing and emerging technologies factor into the challenges of safe data handling by essentially changing how tech users engage with their devices and choose to save private or sensitive information. Sensitive information is readily available in the palms of the hands of these tech users, which makes it easier for malicious actors and potential threats to become a bigger concern, in general.
