# Introduction to asset security
> You will be introduced to how organizations determine what assets to protect. You'll learn about the connection between managing risk and classifying assets by exploring the unique challenge of securing physical and digital assets. You'll also be introduced to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
# Learning Objectives
