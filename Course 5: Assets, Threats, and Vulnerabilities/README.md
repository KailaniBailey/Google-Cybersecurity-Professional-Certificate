# Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities
Course 5 of 8 in the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate
# About This Course
This is the fifth course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. These courses will equip you with the skills you need to apply for an entry-level cybersecurity job. Youâ€™ll build on your understanding of the topics that were introduced in the fourth Google Cybersecurity Certificate course.

In this course, you will explore the concepts of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities. First, you'll build an understanding of how assets are classified. Next, you will become familiar with common threats and vulnerabilities, and the security controls used by organizations to protect valuable information and mitigate risk. You will develop an attacker mindset by practicing the threat modeling process, and you'll learn tactics for staying ahead of security breaches.

Google employees who currently work in cybersecurity will guide you through videos, provide hands-on activities and examples that simulate common cybersecurity tasks, and help you build your skills to prepare for jobs. 

Learners who complete this certificate will be equipped to apply for entry-level cybersecurity roles. No previous experience is necessary.
