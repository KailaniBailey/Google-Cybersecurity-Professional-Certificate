# Protect organizational assets
> You will focus on security controls that protect organizational assets. You'll explore how privacy impacts asset security and understand the role that encryption plays in maintaining the privacy of digital assets. You'll also explore how authentication and authorization systems help verify a userâ€™s identity.
# Learning Objectives
- Identify effective data handling processes.
- Identify how security controls mitigate risk.
- Discuss the role encryption and hashing play in securing assets.
- Describe how to effectively use authentication as a security control.
- Describe effective authorization practices that verify user access.
