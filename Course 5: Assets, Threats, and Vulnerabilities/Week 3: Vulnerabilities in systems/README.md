# Vulnerabilities in systems
> You will build an understanding of the vulnerability management process. You'll learn about common vulnerabilities and develop an attacker mindset by examining the ways vulnerabilities can become threats to asset security if they are exploited.
# Learning Objectives
- Differentiate between vulnerabilities and threats.
- Describe the defense in depth strategy.
- Explain how common vulnerability exposures are identified by MITRE.
- Explain how vulnerability assessments are used to assess potential risk.
- Analyze an attack surface.
- Develop an attacker mindset to recognize threats.
