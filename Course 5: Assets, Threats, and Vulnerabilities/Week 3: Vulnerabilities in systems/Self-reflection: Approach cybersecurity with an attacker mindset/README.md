# Self-reflection: Approach cybersecurity with an attacker mindset

## Consider what you reviewed about applying an attacker mindset in relation to securing your home environment: 

What are the attack surfaces of a home? Are they physical or digital? What are their vulnerabilities? Are they currently exposed to risk?

1. Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) that describe important characteristics about the attack surfaces of your home. Type your response in the text box.

> The attack surfaces of a home (physical and digital) include: the doors to the home, windows, security and alarm systems, and the few internet & Wi-Fi networks. Their vulnerabilities are all different. For example, if the doors are left unlocked or left open, that is a potential vulnerability. If the windows are left unlocked or open, that's also a vulnerability. If the Wi-Fi networks aren't secure and left without a password, that can also be a vulnerability (they do have passwords though). They're not exposed to risk at the moment but I believe with the windows being glass, they always run the risk of being broken by a rock or other hard object.

## Next, consider how an attacker might exploit the vulnerabilities of that surface.

What are the attack vectors of this surface? Are there multiple entry points? How might the vulnerabilities be exploited? What defenses exist? Can new defenses be added?

2. Now, write 3-5 sentences (60-100 words) that explain what those attack vectors are and how you can apply the tools and/or strategies youâ€™ve learned to protect your home. Type your response in the text box.

> For the attack surfaces of a home, I believe there a few attack vectors that differ from one another. For example, an 'attacker' or burglar could pick at a locked door in order to gain entry. They could throw a hard rock through the glass windows. A hacker could even sit and attempt to gain access to the Wi-Fi network for malicious intent. Multiple entry points can also be taken into consideration. For example, the attacker could try their luck at the door handle and, if left unlocked, then they could gain entry into the home that way... rather than picking the lock or breaking in through the windows. If the attacker is known to the homeowner then they may also be able to connect to the home network and Wi-Fi network using a password that they were given. In this case, hacking would be unnecessary because they'd have easy-access to the digital surface. Defenses can be taken such as double-checking that the doors are all locked, as well as the windows... making sure they're shut, locked and secure. Making sure that the Wi-Fi network has a strong password that can't be easily hacked or compromised. Even choosing to buy a more expensive, customized glass that's crack resistant and less vulnerable to being ruined by external forces.
