# Network operations
> You will explore network protocols and how network communication can introduce vulnerabilities. In addition, you'll learn about common security measures, like firewalls, that help network operations remain safe and reliable.
# Learning Objectives
- Recognize network protocols
- Describe the protocol(s) used to transmit and access data over wireless networks
- Describe a firewall
- Identify common network security measures and protocols
