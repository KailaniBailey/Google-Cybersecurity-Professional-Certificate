# Strategies to learn new skills
Using Linux commands is an important skill for cybersecurity professionals. As you develop your Linux command-line skills, you may find that certain learning strategies work better for you than other strategies. It will be helpful to reflect on how you learn and consider what strategies you can use to help you achieve your goals as you continue learning.

For this discussion prompt, consider the following questions:

- What are the general strategies you use when learning something new? How might these strategies be useful when learning Linux commands?
- If you have previously learned Linux commands, what general advice do you have for others based on your experiences? If you haven't previously learned Linux commands, what interests you most about learning them?

Please write two paragraphs in response to these questions (100-200 words). 

## My Response
> When learning something new I typically read about the topic first before watching videos or working on practice problems and labs. Especially with learning how to code or use different operating systems. I will read instructions first and then follow-up with videos to get the visual representation of what I'm learning or trying to understand better.

> I haven't previously learned any Linux commands other than the few that were presented in this lesson. I have, however, learned how to code in other languages, i.e. Python, and have found that using terminals on my own to solve problems has helped me understand how it is to receive an output or error for every input. Concerning Linux commands, I'm interested in learning their level of difficulty. I do consider myself to be a quick learner and can grasp GUI and CLI pretty fast. So, I'd like to see how quickly I can learn Linux commands for career purposes.
