# Strategies to learn new skills
Using Linux commands is an important skill for cybersecurity professionals. As you develop your Linux command-line skills, you may find that certain learning strategies work better for you than other strategies. It will be helpful to reflect on how you learn and consider what strategies you can use to help you achieve your goals as you continue learning.

For this discussion prompt, consider the following questions:

- What are the general strategies you use when learning something new? How might these strategies be useful when learning Linux commands?
- If you have previously learned Linux commands, what general advice do you have for others based on your experiences? If you haven't previously learned Linux commands, what interests you most about learning them?

Please write two paragraphs in response to these questions (100-200 words).
