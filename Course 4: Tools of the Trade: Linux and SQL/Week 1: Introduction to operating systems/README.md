# Introduction to operating systems
> You will learn about the relationship between operating systems, hardware, and software, and become familiar with the primary functions of an operating system. You'll recognize common operating systems in use today and understand how the graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI) both allow users to interact with the operating system.
# Learning Objectives
- Describe the main functions of an operating system.
- Recognize the most common operating systems in use.
- Explain the relationship between operating systems, applications, and hardware.
