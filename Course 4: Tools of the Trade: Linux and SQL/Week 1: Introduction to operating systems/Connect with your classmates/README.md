# My Response
> I do have a bit of knowledge about cybersecurity already, so I'm not entirely a rookie. I also have experience working with and on computers as well as taking things apart and putting them back together. I'm interested in learning about cybersecurity because I'd like to expand my knowledge and also become the best security analyst that I can be with the skills I acquire along the way. I have a passion for securing sensitive information, learning about data and how it's transferred through various devices, an interest in encryption, and a desire to build a substantial portfolio for a career in cybersecurity down whichever specific path I choose.
