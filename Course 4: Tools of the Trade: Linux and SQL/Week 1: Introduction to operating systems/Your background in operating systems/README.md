You may also want to learn more about certain operating systems to improve your skills as a cybersecurity professional.

For this discussion prompt, consider the following questions:

- How familiar are you with each operating system (OS) that was discussed in this course? Are there any that are new to you?
- What operating system do you primarily use and how frequently do you use it? How frequently do you use other operating systems?

## My Response
> I’m not entirely familiar with all of them but I have heard of the majority of them, so none of them are completely new to me. I would say that I’ve used more of the macOS, Android, iOS, Windows, and Chrome operating systems. I’m less familiar with Linux OS but am curious and excited to learn more about it for career purposes. I would like to know more about Linux OS since it’s used heavily in cybersecurity and would be great to have as an additional professional  skill.
