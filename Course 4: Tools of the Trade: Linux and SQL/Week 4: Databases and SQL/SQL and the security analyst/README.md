# SQL and the security analyst
Throughout this course, you learned how to query databases using SQL, and you applied SQL queries to practical cybersecurity-related situations. Now, think of all you learned and how you might use it in the future as a security analyst. Also, reflect on how you will continue to expand your SQL skills.

For this discussion prompt, consider the following questions:

- How might SQL assist you in the tasks you currently need to perform or have needed to perform in the past? (Examples might relate to cybersecurity, but they can also relate to any area of your life.)
- In your opinion, what is the greatest benefit that SQL offers security analysts? How do you envision using SQL as a security analyst?
- How will you continue to use and learn about SQL after this course?

Please write two paragraphs in response to these questions (100-200 words).
