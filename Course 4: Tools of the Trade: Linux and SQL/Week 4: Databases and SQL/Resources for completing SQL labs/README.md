# Resources for completing SQL labs
## Helpful navigation tips and keyboard shortcuts
The following contains a list of navigation tips and keyboard shortcuts you may find useful when completing your SQL labs. Your cursor must be in the terminal window to use these navigation tips and keyboard shortcuts.

- CTRL + C: Terminates a command that is currently running; from the instructions portion of Qwiklabs, you can use CTRL + C to copy, but within the terminal, it will only terminate a command and if one isn't running, it will exit out of the MariaDB shell; if you unintentionally exit, you can reconnect by running the sudo mysql organization command
- CTRL + V: Pastes text
- CTRL + L: Clears the terminal screen; within MariaDB, you must use CTRL + L and cannot use clear
- \c + Enter: Clears the current input
- CTRL + A: Sets your cursor at the beginning of a command
- CTRL + E: Sets your cursor at the end of a command
- Left arrow key: Moves left within a command
- Right arrow key: Moves right within a command
- Up arrow key: Provides the last command you entered into the command line; can be entered multiple times to go through multiple commands from the command history
- Down arrow key: Provides the next command in the command history; must be after using the up arrow key
- Tab key: Provides available suggestions for completing your text

**Note:** If you unintentionally exit the organization database in the MariaDB shell, you can reconnect by running the sudo mysql organization command.
