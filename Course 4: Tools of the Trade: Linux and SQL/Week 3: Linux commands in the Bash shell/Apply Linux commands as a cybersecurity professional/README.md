# Apply Linux commands as a cybersecurity professional
There are lots of commands to learn about in Linux. These commands are used for a variety of cybersecurity tasks. As you continue developing your Linux skills, youâ€™ll likely use additional resources to help you achieve your learning goals.

For this discussion prompt, consider the following questions:

- Which Linux commands do you think will be most important in your role as a cybersecurity professional? Why?
- What resources will you use as you continue to develop your Linux skills?

Please write two paragraphs in response to these questions (100-200 words). 
## My Response
> The Linux commands that I think will be most important in my role as a cybersecurity professional are most likely 'man' and 'apropos'. I believe this answers the second question as well. These commands will both come in use a lot more down the road when I'm learning more commands or when I occasionally forget what command is needed to request or change certain pieces of information.
>
> I also believe that I will continue utilizing search browsers (Google, Mozilla, etc.) to read about information on commands that I may just be less familiar with in general. I've also thought about buying textbooks or more books on cybersecurity and Linux to help keep my mind focused on my GUI and CLI goals while I'm taking 'tech breaks' or taking a lunch break at work.
